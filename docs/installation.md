# INSTALLATION

- We are installing with python's pip package manager.

The required extrernal packages - 

 - transformers
 - stable-baselines3
 - shimmy
 - pandas
 - scipy

---

Install the required packages through pip

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Please Note, as TA-Lib is somehow very difficult to install (through any package manager), I have asked chatGPT to share the function implementations which are residing inside `rl_ppo/talib.py` module.
